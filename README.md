GitHub Calendar Writer
------------------

gitHubCalendarWriter.php is a commandline PHP script that rasterizes text into a displayable message on your github commit calander.

To set a message, modify the first variable of the gitHubCalendarWriter.php file.

When run, it will create a new repo "messageRepo".
All you have to do is push "messageRepo" to github and you will have a message!

Tips
-----
 - Put spaces before your message if you have room (your message will be up longer)
 - Adjust the weight variable to chagne how many commoits per "pixel" are added



test-ttf dumps a binary image to stdout for debugging and testing ttf fonts. mores support coming soon. 
I have had minimal success with rending custom fonts. I need to work on shading when I have some time.
